## Details

Based on the documentation, ADK delivers a comprehensive set of features for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents. Here is a summary of the key capabilities:

### Core Agent Architecture
*   **LLM Agents**: The primary "thinking" unit of ADK, powered by a Large Language Model for reasoning, decision-making, and tool use.
*   **Multi-Agent Systems**: Build complex applications by composing multiple, specialized agents in a hierarchy, enabling delegation and collaboration.
*   **Workflow Agents**: Orchestrate the execution flow of other agents using deterministic patterns:
    *   **Sequential Agents**: Run sub-agents one after another.
    *   **Parallel Agents**: Run sub-agents concurrently.
    *   **Loop Agents**: Run sub-agents in an iterative loop.
*   **Custom Agents**: Implement unique, non-LLM based orchestration logic by extending the `BaseAgent` class for ultimate flexibility.
*   **Agent Config (YAML)**: Build agents declaratively using YAML configuration files, minimizing the need for boilerplate code.

### Tooling and Integrations
*   **Function Tools**: Extend agent capabilities by creating custom tools from standard functions.
*   **Long-Running Function Tools**: Handle asynchronous tasks that take significant time to complete without blocking the agent.
*   **Agents-as-a-Tool**: Use an entire agent as a callable tool within another agent.
*   **Built-in Tools**: Leverage pre-built capabilities like Google Search, Vertex AI Search, and secure code execution.
*   **Google Cloud Tools**: Seamlessly connect to Google Cloud services like API Hub, Application Integration, and databases via MCP Toolbox.
*   **Third-Party Tools**: Integrate tools from popular frameworks like LangChain and CrewAI.
*   **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools**: Use and expose tools via the open MCP standard.
*   **Tool Confirmation**: Implement human-in-the-loop workflows by requiring user confirmation before a tool executes.
*   **Tool Authentication**: Securely manage credentials for tools that access protected APIs.

### Runtime and Context Management
*   **Session & State**: Manage conversational context with a robust session service that tracks history (`Events`) and maintains a working memory (`State`) for each interaction.
*   **Memory**: Enable agents to recall information across multiple sessions using a long-term, searchable knowledge store.
*   **Artifacts**: Allow agents to save, load, and manage versioned files and binary data (e.g., images, PDFs) associated with a session or user.
*   **Callbacks & Plugins**: Hook into the agent's execution lifecycle to implement logging, guardrails, caching, and other cross-cutting concerns.

### Advanced Capabilities
*   **Streaming (Live/Bidi)**: Build real-time, interactive experiences with native support for bidirectional streaming of text, audio, and video.
*   **Streaming Tools**: Create tools that can stream intermediate results back to the agent for real-time monitoring and reaction.
*   **Multi-Model Support**: Flexibly use different LLMs (Gemini, GPT, Claude, etc.) within your agents, powered by integrations like LiteLLM.

### Development Lifecycle
*   **Evaluation**: Systematically assess agent performance by evaluating both the final response quality and the step-by-step execution trajectory.
*   **Observability & Logging**: Gain deep insights into agent behavior with detailed logging and integrations with observability platforms like AgentOps, Arize AX, Cloud Trace, and Weave.
*   **Deployment**: Deploy your agents to a variety of environments, including serverless (Cloud Run), Kubernetes (GKE), and the fully managed Vertex AI Agent Engine.
*   **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol**: Build distributed, multi-agent systems where agents running as separate services can communicate and collaborate using the open A2A standard.
